      While being a true nature lovers and loving camping, we realized that there are not enough reliable information sources about where to stay overnight in a truly wild and beautiful place, but also a safe one.  And we mean places, where you will not be surrounded with lots of other tents and campers. We wanted to create a community of camping lovers, who will not only share their favorite wild camping spots, but also will be able to interact and comment/review those spots, where they have previously stayed.  And all this in order to inspire other people to spend some time close to the nature and wake up with a stunning view. Thatâ€™s why we decided to build an application which sets the basis for a great start.
